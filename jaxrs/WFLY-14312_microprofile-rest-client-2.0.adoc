== Overview

We propose to upgrade the implementation of MicroProfile REST Client in RESTEasy
to implement version 2.0 of the specification
(https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client/releases/tag/2.0).

== Requirements

* RESTEasy will provide an implementation of the latest Microprofile REST Client 2.0 version.
* Existing RESTEasy functionalities are not affected by the update (except for MP tests enforcing old MP spec behaviors, if any)

=== Test Plan

Build and run RESTEasy testsuite, which pulls the MP REST Client TCK in a dedicated testsuite submodule.

== Community Documentation

MP REST Client, currently documented in the RESTEasy User Guide, will be updated.
